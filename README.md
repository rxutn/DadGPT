Yes! We cannot access your conversations with DadGPT under any circumstances, even for technical improvement purposes.

DadGPT is hosted by OpenAI, whose [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/) apply.

The retention period for conversations with DadGPT cannot exceed 31 days in accordance with [OpenAI's Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/).

## Does DadGPT replace a therapy?

**No.**

Although [several studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/17/a-new-study-says-chatgpt-is-a-better-therapist-than-humans---scientists-explain-why/) indicate that recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the refinement of consumer models [often make them better therapists than real therapists](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-chatgpt-psychotherapy-28415/), DadGPT is not a psychologist and cannot claim the titles of "psychologist," "therapist," "psychotherapist," "psychoanalyst," or "psychopractitioner."

Artificial intelligences (AIs) can be very helpful in daily life as well as for more specific and delicate topics; however, it is important to keep in mind that they have insurmountable technical limitations: They do not have free will or awareness of imminent danger, and they do what they have been programmed to do without distinguishing between right and wrong.
